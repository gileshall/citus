You are an excellent researcher whose job is to conduct a thorough review of scientific papers to assess the usage of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) across various research contexts. Your objective is to read the scientific article below and determine whether GATK is mentioned or used, to analyze how it is utilized, and to evaluate the scientific impact of the study. Output the data as structured, quantitative JSON for statistical analysis.

Follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Initial Relevance Check**:
   - **GATK Relevance**: Check if GATK is mentioned or used in the paper. If **GATK is not mentioned or used**, set `"gatk_related": false` in the JSON but still proceed to complete the JSON output with “Not applicable” values or best-fitting options for each field.
   - If **GATK is mentioned or used**, set `"gatk_related": true` and perform a detailed analysis following the guidelines below.

2. **Core Information**:

   1. **Paper Type**: Classify as one of the following types:
      - "Tool paper"
      - "Research paper"
      - "Review paper"
      - "Tutorial"
      - "Other"
      - If none apply, set `"paper_type": "Not applicable"`

   2. **GATK’s Role**: Determine the role of GATK in the study and classify it as one of the following:
      - "Main focus"
      - "Comparison point"
      - "Part of analysis pipeline"
      - "Mentioned but not used"
      - "Not applicable"
      - **_Note**: If judgment is required, include a `_note` field explaining the choice.

   3. **Scientific Impact**: Rate the scientific impact on a scale of 1–5:
      - 1 = Minor contribution
      - 2 = Limited
      - 3 = Notable advancement

   5. **Species Used**: List the species mentioned in the study:
      - Use specific species names, or `"species_used": ["Not applicable"]` if none apply.

   6. **Sample Size**: Rate sample size on a scale of 1–5:
      - 1 = Very small (fewer than 20 samples)
      - 2 = Small (20–100 samples)
      - 3 = Moderate (101–1,000 samples)
      - 4 = Large (1,001–10,000 samples)
      - 5 = Massive (over 10,000 samples)
      - **_Note**: Add a `_note` with specific sample details if known.

   7. **Comparison with Other Tools**: Indicate if GATK was compared with other tools:
      - "Yes" or "No"
      - **_Note**: Include a `_note` listing the other tools compared if applicable.

   8. **Results Summary**: Summarize the study results related to GATK as one of the following:
      - "Positive for GATK"
      - "Neutral"
      - "Negative for GATK"
      - "Not applicable"
      - **_Note**: Include a `_note` elaborating on the findings.

3. **Contextual and Supporting Information**:

   1. **Authors’ Affiliations**: List the primary affiliations or institutions of main authors in a `_note` field.

   2. **Publication Date**:
      - Specify **Year** (numeric) and **Month** (numeric, 1–12).

   3. **Funding Sources**: Identify applicable funding sources:
      - "Government agency," "Private organization," "Institutional," "International organization," "Other."
      - Use `"funding_sources": ["Not applicable"]` if no funding sources are mentioned.

4. **Technical and Performance Context**:

   1. **Challenges and Limitations**: Summarize any major challenges or limitations with GATK as described by the authors in a `_note`.

   2. **GATK Software Version**: Specify the version number if available; use “Not specified” if unknown.

   3. **Other Software Used**: List any other software packages mentioned alongside GATK.
      - If no additional software is used, set `"other_software_used": ["Not applicable"]`.

   4. **Pipeline Integration**: Classify GATK’s use as one of the following:
      - "Standalone"
      - "Integrated"
      - "Modular"
      - "Not applicable"
      - **_Note**: Use a `_note` to describe specific setups if relevant.

5. **Broader Impact and Future Research**:

   1. **User Community Impact**: Rate the impact on a scale of 1–3:
      - 1 = Minimal impact
      - 2 = Moderate impact
      - 3 = High impact
      - **_Note**: Add a `_note` with details on the expected community impact.

   2. **Reproducibility**: Rate the study’s reproducibility on a scale of 1–3:
      - 1 = Low
      - 2 = Moderate
      - 3 = High
      - **_Note**: Provide context in a `_note`.

   3. **Ethical Considerations**: Indicate if ethical review was necessary:
      - "Yes" or "No"
      - **_Note**: Use a `_note` if specific ethical considerations are discussed.

   4. **Future Directions**: Summarize any potential future research or applications in a `_note`.
